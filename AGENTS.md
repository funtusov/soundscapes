## Collaboration / Non-overwrite rule

- This repo may be edited by multiple agents/people concurrently.
- Before making changes, always check `git status` and review diffs for any files that already have uncommitted modifications.
- Do **not** overwrite or discard changes in files you did not author in the current session/task.
- If your planned implementation conflicts with existing edits, stop and ask the user/maintainer how to reconcile the conflict before proceeding.
