## Hand Controls Calibration Mode

Add an optional calibration step/mode where users perform specific actions to automatically tune settings for their setup:

- **Pinch calibration**: Ask user to pinch fully closed, then open naturally - derive optimal pinch/rearm thresholds
- **Distance calibration**: Ask user to position hand at comfortable playing distance - set pointer zone max
- **View mapping calibration**: Ask user to touch corners of their intended play area - auto-set the mapping rectangle
- **Vibrato calibration**: Ask user to shake hand naturally - calibrate sensitivity

Could be triggered via a "Calibrate" button in the hand controls panel, walking through each step with visual feedback.
